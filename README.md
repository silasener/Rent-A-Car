# Rent-A-Car

**Project Description:**

I developed a web-based project using the Spring Boot framework, PostgreSQL database management system, and Hibernate ORM framework for handling database operations. The architecture is well-structured into different layers, including the business, data access, and presentation layers, with data transfer between layers handled by DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes.

**Key Features:**
- API endpoints defined using Spring MVC
- Integration with Swagger UI for browsing functionalities, testing parameters, and viewing documentation
- Customized exception handling and data validation using Java Bean Validation API and Hibernate Validator
- CRUD operations for car brands and models through the API

**Technologies Used:**
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Hibernate ORM
- Spring MVC
- Swagger UI
- Java Bean Validation API
- Hibernate ValidatorSure!
  
**Usage:**

When the project is running successfully, users can access the API by sending requests to **localhost:8080** and using the Swagger UI interface. Through the API, users can perform the following operations:
- View car brands and models
- Add new car brands and models
- Update existing car brands and models
- Delete car brands and models

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this web-based project demonstrates the effective use of Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Hibernate ORM to develop a well-structured application with a layered architecture. The integration of Spring MVC and Swagger UI allows for easy browsing and testing of API endpoints, while customized exception handling and data validation ensure the accuracy of incoming requests. The project provides a user-friendly interface for managing car brands and models through CRUD operations.
