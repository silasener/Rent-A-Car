# Rent-A-Car
I developed a web-based project using the Spring Boot framework. I opted for the PostgreSQL database management system and utilized the Hibernate ORM framework for handling database operations.

I developed a well-structured architecture consisting of different layers, including the business layer, data access layer, and presentation layer. I used DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes for data transfer between these layers.


In this web-based project, I used Spring MVC to define API endpoints. Additionally, I integrated Swagger UI into the project. This allows users to browse the main functionalities of the project through the relevant API endpoints, test parameters, and view documentation.

I customized exception classes and implemented a global exception handling mechanism for error management. I used the Java Bean Validation API and Hibernate Validator for data validation. This enabled me to ensure the accuracy of incoming requests and effectively handle erroneous requests.


When the project runs successfully, user can access the API by sending requests to localhost:8080 and utilize the Swagger UI interface. Through the API, users can view car brands and models, add new brands and models, update existing brands and models, and perform deletion operations.
